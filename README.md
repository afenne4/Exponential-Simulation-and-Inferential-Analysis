# Exponential-Simulation-and-Inferential-Analysis

## Synopsis
There are two files in this repository. The first is primarily concerned with conducting a monte carlo simulation of the exponential distribution to 
examine how summary statistics are distributed. It was discovered that mean values were normally distributed, but variance was skewed. Further
analysis demonstrates that with larger sample sizes the distribution of variances approaches a normal distribution.

In the second file,
