# Exponential-Simulation-and-Inferential-Analysis

There are two files in this repository, "Exponential-Simulation-script.pdf" and "Inferential-Analysis-of-Tooth-Growth.pdf". 
The first is primarily concerned with conducting a monte carlo simulation of the exponential distribution to examine how summary statistics 
are distributed. It was discovered that mean values were normally distributed, but variance was skewed. Further analysis demonstrates that 
with larger sample sizes the distribution of variances approaches a normal distribution.

In the second file, "Inferential-Analysis-of-Tooth-Growth.pdf", data from the
